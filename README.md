## 🧠 The Process

The purpose of this app was to deepening my knowledge in typescript. The main steps included creating an input field to add new tasks, displaying them with filtering options (`completed` / `not completed`), and enabling users to delete tasks.  
Each task is persisted using `localStorage`.
